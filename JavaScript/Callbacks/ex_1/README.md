# Exercise 1
Create a function called map that takes two inputs:

-An array of numbers (a list of numbers);

-A 'callback' function - a function that is applied to each element of the array (inside of the function 'map');

Have map return a new array filled with numbers that are the result of using the 'callback' function on each element of the input array.
